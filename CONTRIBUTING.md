# Guiding Principles for Contribution
First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute! The HRI Team values your contribution. 

Since we have not completely moved our development into the open yet, external contributions are limited. If you would like to make contributions, please create an issue detailing the change. We will work with you to get it merged in.
