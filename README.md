# Health Record Ingestion service
The IBM Watson Health Health Record Ingestion service is an open source project designed to serve as a “front door”, receiving health data for cloud-based solutions. This repo contains the [documentation](https://alvearie.github.io/HRI/) for the project.

Other repos include:
- [Alvearie/hri-api-spec](https://github.com/Alvearie/hri-api-spec)
- [Alvearie/hri-mgmt-api](https://github.com/Alvearie/hri-mgmt-api)

## Editing the documentation
This repo uses Jekyll https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ with the Dinky theme. The default layout was modified to include a high-level page listing on the left. To add links modify `_data/siteindex.md`.

### How to render locally
* Prerequisites:
  * Requires Ruby 2.6.3 or higher
    * Check your Ruby version at cmd line: `$ ruby --version`
    * To upgrade your Ruby version go, follow [instructions here to install & run rvm ](https://codingpad.maryspad.com/2017/04/29/update-mac-os-x-to-the-current-version-of-ruby).
    * Your rvm command will be something like: `$ rvm install ruby-2.6.3`   
    * You may also need to run `gem update --system`.
    * If you are successful with that, continue onto running the bundler in the next step

* Run the bundler: `bundle install`
* Make the template think it's running in github pages by setting the env var: `export PAGES_REPO_NWO=alvearie/HRI`
* Start up the Jekyll server: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
* In your browser, go to `localhost:4000`

**Note**: Several IDEs (like IntelliJ) are very good at rendering `.md` files, but it can be different from Jekyll's rendering. This is probably sufficient for minor changes and additions, but significant changes should be rendered locally.

### Diagrams
The diagrams are created with `draw.io`. You can download the app from github: https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases/. All diagrams are png images with an embedded diagram, so they can be easily updated. To create a new one use File -> Export as -> PNG..., and select 'Include a copy of my diagram'. Also select 'Transparent Background' and set the boarder width to `10`. Save the images to `assets/img`.
